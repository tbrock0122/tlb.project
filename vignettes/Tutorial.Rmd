## Easy Analysis

This package is meant to streamline the process of performing simple statistical analyses using linear data. Namely, performing a linear regression analysis between two variables in a data set.

provide rationale for why someone might need to do this analysis. explain how functions work (e.g. what types of data used, what outputs are, what's expected for inputs)

```{r}

linear_regression(Data$Estimated_Age, Data$SVL)

```
