### This package is meant to streamline the process of performing simple statistical analyses using linear data. Namely, performing linear regression analyses and analyses of variance between two variables in a given data set. Both of these analyses are quite useful in determining if there are statistically significant relationships/interactions between the different kinds of data you may be taking in a project, and are commonly used for introductory biostatistics.
